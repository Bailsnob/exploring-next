if we are exporting html through a function, it must start with a capital letter

page functions typically titled based on what the page is doing

when you output html, react and nextjs are generating keys for each element

useEffect hook only runs once when second argument passed as empty arr

client-side data fetching is best for data which doesn't require frequent changes
  ex: horrible choice for stock ticker

static data fetching: pregeneration during build time

fetchposts is async, fetching data from URL using http req, waits because we told it to, parses using function

- dynamic routing: routing system can respond to variables through bracketed parameters; way to create page through template with arguments provided

- catchall page: page for every other possible path; special 403

- 403 means no path match and no catchall

- Link simulates linking without doing a html hyperlink; for single page applications

- client side data fetching should be used when something needs to be updated constantly

- server component - gotten before the site is sent to user; non-interactive

- apis usually exchange json

- apis exchange data btwn websites and also allow us to cross the client server divide

Stuff to add:
- could add nesting to allow for admin privilidges
